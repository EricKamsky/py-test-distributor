Python Distributed Test Runner Client
++++++++++++++=======================

This is the client for the Python Distributed Test Runner.  It
exposes a list that should be initialized with a list of tests,
and will then return a subset of those tests one-by-one.

`The source for this project is available here
<https://github.com/rularner/py-test-distributor/>`_.

Importing this probject in your test runner should be sufficient to use it.
